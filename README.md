## Server Commands for everyone

The Server currently supports several convenience functions. Please refer to the following list:

__All commands are typed into the chat (Press the T key) and need the leading / (slash)__

### Durability Ping
Will send a message to you if you tool has 10% of usage remaining.
Enter `/trigger duraPing` to change your personal settings.

### Coordinates HUD
You can enable showing your XYZ coordinates, looking direction and world time.
To enable or disable use `/trigger ch_toggle`

### Set Home, teleport there - and back!
We've enabled home zones on the server. You can use it at any location; it will set your home. You will still respawn at the last bed you used / at the original spawn point, but you can use commands to teleport yourself to your home with a cooldown of 10 Seconds. This won't work if you are currently attacked by a monster, or if you are drowning.

#### Setting your home
Stand on any solid block and type `/trigger sethome`
An automated message will tell you if you've been successful.

#### Teleporting to your home
If you want to teleport to your home you may use `/trigger home`. See above for restrictions.

#### Teleporting "back"
To return to your previous position after teleporting home OR in the event of your death you may use `/trigger back`. 

#### Naming your home
While holding a name tag you can name your home with the command `/trigger namehome`

#### Deleting a home
You can delete your home with the command `/trigger delhome`
